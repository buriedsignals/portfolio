      <p>I’m a creative producer and aspiring visual journalist (ou can check out my portfolio [here](https://tomvaillant.com)). 
      </p>
      <p>
      I’m also a co-founder of the non-profit [Wallrunners](wallrunners.org) where I spend time building parkour academies where they’re most needed.

      Past gigs have found me working as an integrated producer or content creator with Red Bull, Immersive Garden and North Kingdom. I started out by making [documentaries](redbull.com/wallrunners) and [films](https://vimeo.com/145770250). </p>
